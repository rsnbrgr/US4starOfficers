# US4starOfficers
CSV for all active duty U.S. four-star military officers, general or admiral, aka "FOGOs"

I offer this project to the PUBLIC DOMAIN

This project offers a CSV file that tracks all active duty U.S. four-star military officers, general or admiral, aka "FOGOs" (flag officer / general officer)

I launched this project to support a separate project of mine: the BarnOwl Case Study, which operates a Twitter 'bot known as @DaysGWOT that will use the CSV to compare & contrast FOGOs tenures & ages to the length of the Global War on Terror.
